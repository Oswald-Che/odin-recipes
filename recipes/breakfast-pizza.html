            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the broiler.</li>
                <li> Heat the butter in a large nonstick pan.</li>
                <li> When the butter is fully melted, season the eggs with salt and pepper, then add to the pan, 
                    along with the ham strips.</li>
                <li> Cook, using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to keep stirring the eggs as they set.</li>
                <li> Remove the pan from the heat about 30 seconds before the eggs are fully done
                     (they'll continue to cook in the pan and in the oven).</li>
                <li> Slather each English muffin half with a good spoonful of salsa.</li>
                <li> Divide the eggs among the English muffins, then top with the cheese.</li>
                <li> Place all the English muffins on a baking sheet and broil (6" from the heat is ideal) 
                    until the cheese is fully melted and browned around the edges.</li>
            </ol>
