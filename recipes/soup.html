        <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
        <p> <h2>Required ingredients</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>11⁄4 cups finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese </li>
                <li> 1 jar (4 oz) diced pimentos </li>
                <li> 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</li>
                <li>1⁄4 cup finely sliced scallions </li>
                <li> 1⁄4 cup 2% Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp olive-oil mayonnaise </li>
                <li>Few shakes Tabasco </li>
                <li>8 slices of bread </li>
                <li> Butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to make it</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the cheese, pimentos, jalapeño, scallions, 
                        yogurt, mayonnaise, and a few shakes of Tabasco in a mixing bowl. </li>   
                    <li>Divide among 4 slices of bread and top with the remaining slices. </li>   
                    <li>Heat a bit of butter in a cast-iron skillet or non- stick pan over medium heat. </li>    
                    <li> Cook the sandwiches, turning once, for about 10 minutes, until golden brown on both sides and the cheese is melted (have patience—an 
                        extra minute or two means everything with good grilled cheese!).</li>
                </ol>
